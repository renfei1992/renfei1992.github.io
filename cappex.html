                    <p>Cappex is a web platform that has helped 10 million students navigate through college admissions. For a long time, Cappex has been serving prospective students with the information they need regarding colleges. <br><br>However, some of the features are outdated to meet the students' needs. Let's why we started to redesign every feature we have to make them better. Our goal is simple: college admissions are complicated, we want to guide students through the journey and help explore the colleges to find the true fits.</p>

                    <p class="separate">We scheduled interviews and conducted surveys to drive the problem-solving process. Here are some key insights that shaped the final solutions.</p>

                        <p class="separate">From our user research, we discovered two types of search needs: exact search and exploratory search. When students do not have sufficient domain knowledge to conduct the exact search, the exploratory search is highly preferred. They want to quickly discover the colleges that match their preferences. <br><br>However, our search experience did not provide the best experience when students were looking to explore colleges.</p>

                        <p class="separate">Once a user passes the college search, they will land on college profiles to learn more about each college. From previous user interviews, a major pain point of consuming the college information is locating the correct content and understand the meaning of the information.<br><br>We conducted various types of research and concluded that students couldn't always find the info from the pages they expected.</p>

                    <p class="separate">As an information hub, we can provide students every piece of information about each college they are interested in. But the most efficient way is to explain how the information matters to each individual student. <br><br>Instead of overloading information, we could personalize the experience so that every student can consume the information easily and learn quickly about colleges. We mapped out the customer journey and focused more on improving where the business participates at the moment.</p>

                    <p class="separate">At the beginning of the project, we felt we haven't identified the problems and potential opportunities well enough. Therefore, we decided to do exploratory user research first. Knowing we had only 6 months to deliver the project, we planned the research and design process as the following. The details of the research process are presented in the last section of this case study.</p>

                    <p class="separate">The word "fit" came up a lot during our conversations with students and parents, but their definition of "fit" are all different. Most of our customers could not communicate what colleges they are looking for exactly. They viewed the search experience is often a way to educate themselves.
                    <br><br>Then we reviewed our current search interface and we identified a few issues.</p>

Once they pass the college search, they will land on college profiles that provide information on each college.<br><br>We have more than 300 data points on each college, and from the research, locating data points is one of the major pain points for users, along with several other issues:</p>

                    <p class="separate">College search should be simple and fun. Ideally, students should feel excited and motivated when browsing and learning about colleges. From interviewing them, we realized that "the college experience" means a lot to students. Therefore, when we design the college search, we tried to bring a taste of the campus and college life to the students so that they don't get bored when doing the research.</p>

                    <p class="separate">Looking back, Cappex had not been keeping up with the user needs very well. Also, as the product team here, we felt we <strong>haven't developed the empathy for users and understand their journey well enough</strong>. <br><br>To understand user pain points better, we decided to do exploratory user research first at large scale. We focused on qualitative insights first to understand the general journey steps and pain points, and then focused on quantifying pain points with the job-to-be-done framework.</p>
                    <h5>Exploratory Customer Interviews</h5>
                    <p class="separate">We started by interviewing our customers, students and parents, to understand the general steps they took on the admissions journey and the major pain points they faced. We conducted 3 rounds of interviews and interviewed over 60 students and parents in total.</p>

The college admissions journey includes 8 big steps, each 8 step may also contain several small steps. Although the journey is not in a strictly linear order, we could present it in a relatively linear more conveniently as the following:</p>

                    <p class="separate">From the interviews, we also collected nearly a hundred potential problems to solve. However, we understood that we are a small company with unlimited resources and that solving many problems at the same time would not be realistic. Therefore, we decided to prioritize the problems.<br><br>Firstly, we wrote down the potential problems in the format of outcome statements students want to achieve. For example, one outcome statements could be "minimize the time it takes to search for admissions requirements". Then we worked with Qualtrics to send the outcome statements to over one thousand students and parents via a survey to evaluate 2 metrics for each statement:<br><br><strong>Importance</strong>: how important to achieve the outcome<br><strong>Satisfaction</strong>: how satisfied with the market solutions to achieve the outcome</p>

We gave each participant 30 cards and each card contains one statement about a college. Participants were asked to sort each card into 5 pre-defined groups. If a participant finds that it is hard to group some cards into the groups, the participant can create a new group and name the new group.<br><br>The card-sorting was done online via a survey tool as in the following image.</p>

                    <p class="separate">As we were redesigning Cappex, we wanted to avoid any issues that stop users from completing their tasks. Before launching new features, we conducted a series of usability testing sessions to validate design assumptions and identify usability problems.<br><br>We track and prioritize the issues identified through usability testing, and set a 2-month feedback cycle. For every 2 months, we do another round of usability testing to identify new issues and validate whether the design change solves the issues found previously.</p>
