                    <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
                    <p>Catalant serves as an online marketplace that helps businesses find the right talent resource for their critical initiatives or projects. Tailored to the project needs, We help business project owners use our platform to browse and identify experts from both their internal talent pool and the external marketplace.<br><br>To the project owners, finding the right experts and jumpstarting the project quickly is the key to their success. Our platform gives them access to over 65,000 industry experts and 1,000 boutique consulting firms. However, it had not been always easy to find the best one from the entire talent pool.<br><br>Therefore, the project is to support project owners with the right tools to find their gold through among all the glitters. </p>

                    <h3 class="headline">How to Support User Decision Making</h3>
                    <p class="separate">We have seen a high abandon rate from project owners after browsing experts. For Catalant, it is costly to seize the business opportunities if we lose our customers at such an early stage.<br><br>One of the most critical moments for a new user is to figure out "who are these experts". But unfortunately, the Browse experience did not provide users an intuitive way to easily identify the right talent resource on the platform. Instead, project owners have to carry the mental work on their own and feel helpless browsing experts.</p>
                    <h5>Support Exploratory Search</h5>
                    <p>The project owners do not always have the domain knowledge of the role they are recruiting for. They do not know which skills or industries they should search unless they reach out to our internal teams for help. Our Browse experience provided a "flat" experience with the assumption that users knew what they want to look up.</p>
                    <img src="images/catalant/exploratory_search.png" alt="" class="extra-separate width-80">
                    <h5>Support Decisions and Actions</h5>
                    <p>A good Browse experience would consider the information needs of users at various stages. For example, on the search page, users might only need the key information to browse quickly. But at later stages, users might need further information to compare similar experts.</p>
                    <img src="images/catalant/missing_steps.png" alt="" class="extra-separate width-80">
                    <h5>Competitive Market Matchup</h5>
                    <p>Although we have our niche, our Browse experience does not have to sacrifice its user experience. In some cases, the switching cost from us to our competitors is low. When that happens, user experience becomes the key to win customers. We should compare our application to similar products in the market to win the experience war.</p>

                    <p class="separate">We divided the Browse experience into 3 phases and project owners have a goal at the end of each stage. Making sure that they can achieve the goal is critical to move them closer to the next stage.<br><br>The question is, how do we help the project owners achieve those goals? The strategy is simple - we help them with the decision-making process and provide only effective information and necessary features that matter to each decision point.</p>
                    <img src="images/catalant/journey_map.png" alt="" class="extra-separate">
                    <h5>Phase 1: Brief Browsing</h5>
                    <p class="separate">It always starts with a new project. When project owners have new projects, they start collecting project requirements and searching for experts who meet the requirements. At this stage, they focus more on the quantity of information over the quality. Their goal is to quickly browse experts' info and identify the ones they are interested in learning more about. </p>
                    <h5>Phase 2: Understand the Fit</h5>
                    <p class="separate">After the brief browsing, the next step for project owners is to understand how well those experts will fit with their projects with more details. They try to narrow down to a manageable amount of experts to contact. They ask a few questions when reviewing the experts' profile: Does the expert have the skills to ace this project? Does the expert have enough industry experience to lead? Can this expert work onsite...</p>
                    <h5>Phase 3: Assess through Comparison</h5>
                    <p class="separate">Sometimes there is a situation that a few experts seem qualified, at this time, making a decision is very hard. A tiny piece of detail could make one of the experts stand out. When comparing a few experts with similar qualifications, a game-changer could be as small as a skill, a few bucks per hour, or a previous work sample. At this phase, their goal is to find the best expert to reach out through side-by-side comparison.</p>

The comparison feature helps lay out the most important information needed to compare at this stage, so project owners can focus on comparing experts and making decisions.</p>

                    <h3 class="headline">Things We Did to Make It Happen</h3>
                    <p class="separate">One of the biggest challenges when designing the Browse experience is <strong>to understand the information needs from users at various levels</strong>. Knowing that we had limited resources and time for user research, we needed to make sure we value every opportunity interviewing and getting feedback from users.
                    <br><br>The strategy was to prepare as much as possible before going into actual field research. I collaborated with my team and started our research early enough, so when we started talking with real users, we always had specific goals in mind. That saved us a lot of time discussing design decisions when there was not enough data to support. </p>
                    <h5>Heuristics Evaluation</h5>
                    <p class="separate">Before kicking off the exploratory user research, I did an analysis of the current search interface and match score. Multiple usability issues were found through the heuristics evaluation. I categorized the issues into cosmetic problems, minor usability problems, and major usability problems.<br><br>The major problems that need to be solved include low satisfaction of the exploratory search needs, lack of explanation for search filters and necessary interpretation of match score.</p>

                    <h5>Competitive Research</h5>
                    <p class="separate">When I was working on the heuristics evaluation, other team members focused their effort on competitive analysis to see how they design for their users. We identified and analyzed a few products that involve solving for similar user needs, including LinkedIn, Entelo, and Upwork. <br><br>We studied and discussed the pros and cons of each competitors' search design and shared how we think we can provide a better experience. We brought the pros and cons of each competitor to our unique use cases and discussed what to use or avoid.</p>

                    <h5>Contextual Inquiry</h5>
                    <p class="separate">Once we gained a solid understanding of how our product and our competitors' products perform, we started to interview project owners while they were performing searching for experts. I led the semi-structured interview process by planning the tasks to perform and questions to ask.
                    <br><br>The questions I asked focused on the information project owners need at various phases. I also observed how they used the product today in a more realistic way. Through the interview, we also identified that the project owners are not always the final decision-makers in deciding which experts to hire.</p>

                    <h5>Journey Mapping with User Goals</h5>
                    <p class="separate">The next step was to visualize the user goals and pain points after we had a good understanding. To save time from the back-and-forth discussion of how we should divide the journey, we used the concept of a universal job map from the job-to-be-done framework. 
                    <br><br>At every phase, we listed the users' goals and pain points. We also listed what we had done to address the pain points and how well we addressed them.</p>

                    <p class="separate">Understanding every edge case was important and creating an intuitive interface to contain the 3 phases of browsing was critical.

                    <p class="separate">The UI design iterations were highly impacted by user feedback. For every iteration, I scheduled feedback sessions with both internal teams and external stakeholders to get their feedback. 
                    <br><br>Some valuable feedback includes that the "Top 10%" created confusion that the score was relevant to the entire expert pool but not the project needs; the "x" icon that indicates "not a match" made users think it was a button.<br><br>We fixed the major usability issues through iterations and launched the features to the platform.</p>
